# Project-Background
#### The integration of technology known as "AI" has the potential to change numerous industries. However, there is a significant difference between what companies claim they can accomplish using AI and what they actually do with it. Several factors could account for such a disparity: the adoption of AI tools is costly because it tends to jeopardise an incumbent's operations; there is a scarcity of human capital trained in the field of AI; and developing AI applications may require businesses to deal with ethical and regulatory issues. Another barrier to AI adoption in knowledge-intensive businesses is "professionals." While some people may be excited to incorporate AI into their everyday job, others may feel intimidated. This project is concerned with the distribution of securities traders' perspectives on the influence AI may have on "trading floors."
